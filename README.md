# A Simple React List - Exercise 🧐

###

A simple static React list I built as part of an exercise, focusing on rendering data efficiently with React. The project helped reinforce fundamental concepts like components, props, and mapping over arrays to display dynamic content. While basic, it served as a great practice in structuring React applications and handling lists in a clean, reusable way. 💡
